## ðŸŽ® Pearl Harbor Game 

Excited to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on! ðŸŽ®

As part of my university's game zone, I developed a 3D game using Unity that recreates the Pearl Harbor attackâ€”but with a modern twist! Set in 2023, the game places you in the heat of the action, operating a machine gun to defend the harbor as waves of enemy planes descend. It's an intense and immersive experience that combines both fun and the dread of historical conflict.

Check out this video footage of the gameplay! ðŸŽ¥
