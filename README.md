## 🎮 Pearl Harbor Game 

Excited to share a project I’ve been working on! 🎮

As part of my university's game zone, I developed a 3D game using Unity that recreates the Pearl Harbor attack—but with a modern twist! Set in 2023, the game places you in the heat of the action, operating a machine gun to defend the harbor as waves of enemy planes descend. It's an intense and immersive experience that combines both fun and the dread of historical conflict.
